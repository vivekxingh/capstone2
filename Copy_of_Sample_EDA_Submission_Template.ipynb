This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."

There is also a positive correlation between 'total_guest' and 'total_stay_in_nights' and 'revenue'. So, bookings with more guests and a longer duration tend to generate more revenue for the hotel"
